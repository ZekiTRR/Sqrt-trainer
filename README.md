## 💻 How to Use
1. The program will display a message like:  
   `Enter the sqrt of: 169`
2. Enter the **square root** of the number (for example, for 169 the correct answer is 13).
3. If you make a mistake, you will see:  
   `❌ No, sqrt of 169 was = 13`
4. To exit, press `Ctrl + C` (or close the console).

## 📝 Example
```
Enter the sqrt of: 25
> 5
Enter the sqrt of: 144
> 12
Enter the sqrt of: 81
> 9  # Oops!
❌ No, sqrt of 81 was = 9
```
